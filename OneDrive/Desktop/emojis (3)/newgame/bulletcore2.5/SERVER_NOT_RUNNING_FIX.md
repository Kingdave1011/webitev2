# Server Not Running - Final Fix

## Problem
Connection is still being reset, which means the PM2 server probably isn't running on EC2.

## SOLUTION: Check and Start the Server on EC2

### Step 1: RDP Back to EC2

Connect to EC2 via Remote Desktop again (IP: 13.59.157.124)

### Step 2: Check if Server is Running

Open Command Prompt on EC2 and run:
```
pm2 status
```

**What you might see:**

**Option A: Server shows as "stopped" or "errored"**
```
pm2 restart matchmaking-server
```

**Option B: PM2 shows empty (no processes)**
```
cd C:\GameServers
pm2 start matchmaking-server.cjs --name matchmaking-server
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

**Option C: Can't find the file**
- Check if `matchmaking-server.cjs` is in `C:\GameServers`
- If not, you need to copy it there from Desktop

### Step 3: Test Manually First

On EC2, try running the server manually to see if it works:
```
cd C:\GameServers
node matchmaking-server.cjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
Matchmaking server running on port 3001
```

**If you see errors:**
- There might be a problem with the server code
- Share the error message

**If it works:**
- Press Ctrl+C to stop it
- Then start with PM2:
```
pm2 start matchmaking-server.cjs --name matchmaking-server
pm2 save
```

### Step 4: Verify It's Running

```
pm2 status
```

Should show: `matchmaking-server | online`

### Step 5: Test Again

On YOUR LOCAL PC:
```
curl http://13.59.157.124:3001
```

Should return: `Cannot GET /` âœ…

## If Server Still Won't Start

The issue might be with Node.js or the server file. On EC2, check:

1. **Is Node.js installed?**
```
node --version
```
Should show a version number

2. **Is the file in the right place?**
```
dir C:\GameServers
```
Should list `matchmaking-server.cjs`

3. **Try running setup script again:**
- Right-click `setup-ec2-server.bat` on Desktop
- Run as administrator

---

## Summary

The connection is reaching EC2, but the server application itself isn't responding. This means PM2 either:
1. Isn't running the server
2. The server crashed
3. The server file is missing

Check PM2 status on EC2 and restart the server!
