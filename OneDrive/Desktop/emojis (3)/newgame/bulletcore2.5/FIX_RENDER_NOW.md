# Fix Render Configuration RIGHT NOW

## What I See in Your Screenshot

Your current Render settings are ALMOST correct, but need small changes:

### ❌ Current (WRONG):
- **Build Command**: `npm install --prefix multiplayer-server`
- **Start Command**: `node multiplayer-server/server.js`

### ✅ Should Be (CORRECT):
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

## How to Fix (3 Easy Steps):

### Step 1: Add Root Directory
1. Scroll up in your Render settings
2. Look for **"Root Directory"** field
3. Enter: `multiplayer-server`
4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Fix Build Command
1. Click **Edit** next to Build Command
2. Change it to just: `npm install`
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Fix Start Command  
1. Click **Edit** next to Start Command
2. Change it to just: `npm start`
3. Click **Save**

## Why This Works

When you set Root Directory to `multiplayer-server`, Render will:
1. Go INTO the multiplayer-server folder
2. Run `npm install` (which finds package.json there)
3. Run `npm start` (which runs the start script in package.json)

## After Saving

1. Click **"Save Changes"** button
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
4. Your server will be live!

## Get Your Server URL

After successful deployment:
1. Copy your Render service URL (e.g., `https://space-shooter-xxxxx.onrender.com`)
2. You'll need this URL to update your website

## Next: Update Website

Once Render is deployed, you need to update `multiplayer-lobby.html`:
```javascript
// Change this line:
const WS_SERVER_URL = 'wss://jw6v6rkm.up.railway.app';

// To your new Render URL:
const WS_SERVER_URL = 'wss://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com';
```

That's it! Your multiplayer will work.
