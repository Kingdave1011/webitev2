# Space Shooter - Online Multiplayer System Specification

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive online multiplayer architecture for Space Shooter, transforming it from a local/peer-to-peer game into a fully online, server-authoritative competitive experience with matchmaking, lobbies, and ranked play.

---

## üéÆ System Architecture Overview

### Core Principle: Server-Authoritative
**All gameplay logic runs on dedicated servers.** Clients send inputs; servers validate, process, and broadcast state updates.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates client-side cheating
- Consistent game state across all players
- Fair competitive environment
- Centralized anti-cheat and monitoring

---

## üîê Online-Only Play with Secure Sessions

### Session Management

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Player logs in via website (already implemented)
2. Receives secure session token (JWT with 24h expiration)
3. Token includes: user_id, username, permissions, MMR, region
4. Game client validates token with auth server before joining matches

**Server-Authoritative Control:**
- **Movement:** Server validates speed, bounds, collision
- **Combat:** Hit detection, damage calculation, death on server
- **Scoring:** Wave completion, kills, bonuses calculated server-side
- **Progression:** XP, unlocks, currency changes server-validated

### Session Types

1. **Public Matchmaking**
   - Quick Play: Fast matches, broad MMR tolerance
   - Ranked: Competitive matches, strict MMR bands

2. **Private Lobbies**
   - Invite-only with unique codes
   - Custom rules (wave difficulty, power-up frequency, etc.)
   - Friends and party support

3. **Custom Matches**
   - Host-controlled settings
   - Practice mode with bots
   - Tournament support

### Verification Gates

**Pre-Match Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Human verification (CAPTCHA for suspicious accounts)
- ‚úÖ Anti-cheat client integrity check
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on match joins (prevent spam)
- ‚úÖ Content version match (all players on same patch)
- ‚úÖ Least-privilege tokens (can only join authorized sessions)

---

## üéØ Match Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Pre-Match (30-60 seconds)

**Player Actions:**
1. Join queue or lobby
2. Select ship/loadout (locked at match start)
3. Map loading and asset validation
4. Ready-up confirmation

**Server Actions:**
1. Validate all players connected
2. Confirm content versions match
3. Allocate game server instance
4. Initialize match state
5. Send map and settings to clients

### Phase 2: In-Match (10-20 minutes typical)

**Wave-Based Progression:**
- 3-minute timer per wave
- Synchronized enemy spawns (server-controlled)
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Booster currency earned in real-time

**Server Responsibilities:**
- Enemy AI control and pathfinding
- Power-up spawn timing and effects
- Boss mechanics and phases
- Score tracking and validation
- Player elimination and respawn logic

**Client Responsibilities:**
- Input capture and transmission
- State interpolation for smooth rendering
- Visual effects and audio
- HUD updates from server data

### Phase 3: Post-Match (15-30 seconds)

**Score Submission:**
1. Server finalizes match statistics
2. Anti-cheat anomaly detection runs
3. Scores signed and submitted to leaderboard service
4. Rewards calculated and distributed
5. MMR updated for ranked matches

**Player Options:**
- Return to lobby (rematch with same players)
- Back to main menu
- View match summary and stats
- Report players if needed

## üé≤ Matchmaking System

### Queue Types

#### Quick Play
**Goal:** Fast matches with acceptable quality

**Parameters:**
- MMR tolerance: ¬±300 initially, expands ¬±100 every 20 seconds
- Max wait time: 2 minutes before bot-fill
- Region: Primary + adjacent regions
- Party size: Solo to 4-player parties
- Target latency: <100ms preferred, <150ms maximum

#### Ranked
**Goal:** Competitive integrity and fair matches

**Parameters:**
- MMR tolerance: ¬±150 initially, expands ¬±50 every 30 seconds
- Max wait time: 5 minutes
- Region: Locked to player's region
- Party size: Solo or full team only
- Target latency: <80ms preferred, <120ms maximum
- Placement matches: 10 games to calibrate new players

### Matchmaking Constraints

**Primary Factors:**
1. **MMR (Matchmaking Rating):** Elo-like system with decay
2. **Region:** NA-East, NA-West, EU, Asia-Pacific, SA, etc.
3. **Input device:** Controller, keyboard/mouse (optional separation)
4. **Platform:** Windows, Linux, Web (cross-play enabled by default)
5. **Party size:** Solo, Duo, Squad (2-4 players)
6. **Latency threshold:** Player-to-server ping limits

### Queue Rules

**Timeout Behavior:**
- **0-30s:** Strict matching within target parameters
- **30s-1m:** MMR band expands by 25%
- **1m-2m:** MMR band expands by 50%, adjacent regions added
- **2m+:** Bot-fill offer presented; accept or continue waiting

**Backfill System:**
- Players can backfill matches with leavers
- Only during first wave (first 3 minutes)
- MMR-appropriate replacements
- Bonus rewards for backfill players

**Party Support:**
- Parties up to 4 players
- Party MMR: Weighted average with +5% penalty per member
- Prevents smurf-stacking (high-skill player + low-skill accounts)
- All party members must meet latency requirements

### Navigation Flow

```
In-Match ‚Üí Pause (ESC) ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Back to In-Match
                       ‚Üì
                  Leave Match ‚Üí Return to Lobby ‚Üí Back to Main Menu
                       ‚Üì
                  Leave Match ‚Üí Back to Main Menu (direct exit)
```

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- All exits properly disconnect from server
- No orphaned sessions or stuck lobby states
- Reconnect logic for accidental disconnects (60-second grace period)

- **Unreliable sequenced:** Player positions, enemy positions, projectiles

**Message Types:**
```
Client ‚Üí Server:
- PlayerInput (move, shoot, ability)
- ChatMessage
- ReadyStatus
- LoadoutChange

Server ‚Üí Client:
- GameStateSnapshot (full state every 100ms)

- ChatBroadcast
```

#### Tick Rate and Reconciliation

**Server Tick Rate:** 30 ticks/second
- Full snapshots: 10Hz (every 100ms)
- Delta updates: 30Hz (every 33ms)

**Client Prediction:**
- Client predicts own movement immediately
- Server reconciles and corrects as needed
- Smooth interpolation between server states

**Lag Compensation:**

- Distant entities: Lower precision, less frequent
- Occluded entities: Minimal updates

---

## üîí Security and Anti-Cheat

### Authentication

**Session Tokens:**

- Player reports tracked
- Suspicious activity flagged
- Review dashboard for moderators

### Anti-Cheat Systems

**Client Integrity:**
- Hash verification of game files
- Memory scanning for known cheats
- Process list monitoring (suspicious apps)
- Fail-closed: Kick if integrity check fails

**Server-Side Validation:**
- **Movement sanity:** Speed caps, collision validation, teleport detection
- **Combat sanity:** Damage per second caps, accuracy thresholds, impossible shots
- **Score anomalies:** Flag outliers (3+ standard deviations from mean)
- **Behavioral patterns:** Bot-like inputs, frame-perfect actions

**Rate Limiting:**
- Per-IP: 100 requests/minute
- Per-account: 50 actions/minute
- Match joins: 10/hour per account
- Chat messages: 1 per 2 seconds

### Ban System

4. **Permanent Ban:** Hardware ID + account ban

---

## üìä Data Architecture

### MMR System

**Elo-Based Rating:**
- Starting MMR: 1500
- K-factor: 32 for <30 matches, 24 for <100, 16 thereafter
- Win/Loss adjustment: ¬±15-40 MMR per match
- Placement matches: 10 games with double K-factor

**MMR Decay:**
- No decay for first 7 days inactive
- 10 MMR/day after 7 days (max 300 loss)
- Stops at original placement MMR

**Uncertainty:**
- New players: High uncertainty (¬±200 MMR confidence)
- Consistent players: Low uncertainty (¬±50 MMR)
- Uncertainty decreases with matches played

    player_id UUID,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    score INT,
    wave_reached INT,
    kills INT,
    deaths INT,
    playtime_seconds INT,
    mmr_change INT,
    match_timestamp TIMESTAMP,

- Limits: Max 100 instances per region (cost caps)

**Load Balancing:**
- Route to lowest-latency available server
- Distribute matchmaking load evenly
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Remove unhealthy instances immediately

### Database Scaling

**Read Replicas:**
- Leaderboard reads: 3 replicas per region
- Match history: 2 replicas globally
- Profile data: Cached aggressively

**Write Sharding:**
- Match results: Shard by timestamp (append-only)
- Player data: Shard by user_id prefix
- Leaderboards: Centralized master + cached copies
