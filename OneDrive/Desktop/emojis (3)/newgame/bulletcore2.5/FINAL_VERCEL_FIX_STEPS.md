# FINAL FIX: Force Vercel Redeployment

## Issue
You've set the Root Directory to `HideoutAdsWebsite` but the changes haven't taken effect yet. You need to trigger a NEW deployment for the changes to apply.

## Solution: Force a New Deployment

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project (the one with hideoutads.online domain)

### Step 2: Trigger a Redeploy
1. Click on the **Deployments** tab
2. Find the most recent deployment
3. Click the **three dots menu** (⋯) on the right side
4. Select **Redeploy**
5. In the popup, click **Redeploy** again to confirm

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- Watch the deployment progress
- Should take 30-60 seconds
- Wait until you see ✅ "Ready"

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
After redeployment completes:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Or open an Incognito/Private window

### Step 5: Test Your APIs
Try these URLs:
```
https://hideoutads.online/api/leaderboard
https://hideoutads.online/api/matchmaking
https://hideoutads.online/api/stats
https://hideoutads.online/api/ai-bot
```

You should now see JSON data instead of 404 errors!

## Alternative: Delete and Re-import Project

If redeployment still doesn't work:

### 1. Delete Current Project
1. Go to your project settings
2. Scroll to bottom → **Delete Project**
3. Type project name to confirm

### 2. Import Fresh from GitHub
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository (Kingdave1011/website1)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Before clicking Deploy:
   - Set **Root Directory** to: `HideoutAdsWebsite`
   - Leave everything else as default
4. Click **Deploy**
5. After deployment, add your custom domain back

## Why This Happens

Vercel caches the old configuration. Changing the Root Directory setting doesn't automatically trigger a new deployment - you must manually redeploy for the changes to take effect.

## Expected Result

After proper redeployment with the correct Root Directory:
- ✅ APIs will work at `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/matchmaking`, etc.
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Your website will load correctly from index.html
