## 🔊 How to Add Your Own Music & Sound Effects

### Method 1: Using Web Audio Files (Recommended)

1. **Prepare Your Audio Files:**
   - Background music: `.mp3` or `.ogg` format
   - Sound effects: `.wav` or `.mp3` format
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (music under 5MB)

2. **Add to HideoutAdsWebsite/game/assets/ folder:**
   ```
   HideoutAdsWebsite/game/assets/
   ├── music/
   │   ├── gameplay.mp3
   │   └── menu.mp3
   └── sounds/
       ├── laser.wav
       ├── explosion.wav
       └── powerup.wav
   ```

3. **Update index.tsx** - Replace the SOUND_ASSETS constant (around line 162):
   ```typescript
   const SOUND_ASSETS: { [key: string]: string } = {
       laser: '/assets/sounds/laser.wav',
       explosion: '/assets/sounds/explosion.wav',
       waveStart: '/assets/sounds/wave.wav',
       music: '/assets/music/gameplay.mp3',
       menuMusic: '/assets/music/menu.mp3'
   };
   ```

### Method 2: Using Base64 Encoded Audio (Current Method)

The game currently uses base64 encoded audio for smaller file sizes. To add more:

1. **Convert your audio to base64:**
   - Use online tool: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/audio
   - Or use command line: `base64 your-sound.wav`

2. **Add to SOUND_ASSETS:**
   ```typescript
   const SOUND_ASSETS: { [key: string]: string } = {
       laser: 'data:audio/wav;base64,YOUR_BASE64_HERE',
       explosion: 'data:audio/wav;base64,YOUR_BASE64_HERE',
       music: 'data:audio/mp3;base64,YOUR_BASE64_HERE',
   };
   ```

## 🎵 For Standalone (Windows/Linux) Version

The standalone version built from the same source code will automatically include all audio functionality. Just make sure:

1. Audio files are included in the build
2. File paths are correct for the platform
3. Audio formats are supported (`.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3`)

## ✅ Verification

Your game's audio system is READY. You just need to:
1. Find music/sound files you want to use
2. Add them using Method 1 or 2 above
3. Rebuild the game

### Quick Test:
The game currently plays placeholder sounds. When you:
- **Shoot** → Laser sound plays
- **Hit enemy** → Explosion sound plays
- **Start wave** → Wave sound plays
- **Level up** → Achievement sound plays

All volume controls work! Adjust them in Settings menu.

## 📝 Notes

- The game's audio initialization requires user interaction (clicking a button) due to browser autoplay policies
- All audio is controlled through the Settings menu
- Music loops automatically during gameplay
- Sound effects play based on game events

Your audio system is fully functional - you just need to add the actual music files you want to use!
