# Sign-In System Verification ✅

## Overview
The Space Shooter sign-in system has been successfully implemented and verified. This document outlines the authentication flow and how it works.

## Authentication Components

### 1. **Standalone Auth Page** (`user-auth.html`)
- Located at: `HideoutAdsWebsite/user-auth.html`
- Accessible from: `https://hideoutads.online/user-auth.html`
- Linked from main navigation with "⭐ Sign In" button

### 2. **In-Game Authentication** (`game/index.tsx`)
- Login screen appears when game loads
- Integrated authentication handlers
- LocalStorage-based account system

## Authentication Flow

### Sign-In Process
1. User visits `user-auth.html` or game directly
2. Three authentication options available:
   - **Sign In**: For existing users
   - **Sign Up**: For new users
   - **Guest**: For temporary play (no save)

### Account Storage
```javascript
// Accounts stored in localStorage with key pattern:
localStorage.getItem(`acct_${username}`)

// Account data structure:
{
  password: "encrypted_password",
  email: "user@example.com",
  created: timestamp
}
```

### Game State Storage
```javascript
// Game progress stored separately:
localStorage.getItem(`space_shooter_${username}`)

// Game state includes:
{
  username: string,
  level: number,
  xp: number,
  credits: number,
  upgrades: {...},
  unlockedShips: [...],
  achievements: [...]
}
```

## Integration Points

### Main Website → Auth Page
```html
<!-- In index.html navigation -->
<a href="user-auth.html">⭐ Sign In</a>
```

### Auth Page → Game
```javascript
// After successful authentication:
window.location.href = 'https://space-shooter-634206651593.us-west1.run.app';

// With session data:
sessionStorage.setItem('space_shooter_auth', JSON.stringify({
  username: username,
  isGuest: isGuest,
  timestamp: Date.now()
}));
```

### Game → Account System
```javascript
// In game/index.tsx:
function loadGameState(username: string) {
  const data = localStorage.getItem(`space_shooter_${username}`);
  // Load and parse game state
}

function saveGameState(username: string) {
  localStorage.setItem(`space_shooter_${username}`, JSON.stringify(gameState));
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Please enter username and password" | Empty fields | Fill in all required fields |

| "Account not found" | User doesn't exist | Sign up first or use correct username |
| "Username already exists" | Duplicate username | Choose different username |
| "Username must be at least 3 characters" | Too short | Use 3+ characters |
| "Password must be at least 4 characters" | Too short | Use 4+ characters |

## Troubleshooting

### Sign-In Not Working?
1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Del
2. **Check localStorage**: F12 → Application → Local Storage
3. **Verify account exists**: Look for `acct_${username}` key
4. **Try different browser**: Test in incognito mode
5. **Check console errors**: F12 → Console

### Game Not Loading After Sign-In?
1. **Check redirect URL**: Should go to game server
2. **Verify session data**: Check sessionStorage
3. **Network issues**: Check internet connection
4. **CORS errors**: Contact site administrator
5. **Browser compatibility**: Try different browser

### Guest Mode Issues?
1. **Progress not saving**: This is expected for guests
2. **Want to save progress**: Create an account
3. **Lost progress**: Guest data clears on browser close
