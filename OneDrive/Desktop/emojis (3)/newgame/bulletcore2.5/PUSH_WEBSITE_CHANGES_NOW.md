# Push Website Changes to Git

## Quick Steps to Push Your Changes

Since there are many untracked files in your user directory, follow these steps to push ONLY the website changes:

### Option 1: Simple Method (Recommended)
```bash
cd HideoutAdsWebsite
git add index.html
git commit -m "Remove admin panel from public homepage banner"
git push origin master
```

### Option 2: If You Need to Add More Files
```bash
cd HideoutAdsWebsite
git add index.html multiplayer-lobby.html
git commit -m "Hide admin panel from public view and update multiplayer"
git push origin master
```

## What Was Changed

‚úÖ **Admin Panel Hidden**: Removed "Admin Panel" reference from the Space Shooter 7.0 promotional banner
- Changed to: "Special Ability ‚Ä¢ Windows .EXE ‚Ä¢ Database Integration ‚Ä¢ Online Multiplayer"
- Admin panel still exists at `/admin-panel.html` but is not advertised publicly

## Railway Multiplayer Server

Your multiplayer server is configured to use Railway at:
- WebSocket URL: `wss://jw6v6rkm.up.railway.app`
- This is already set up in `multiplayer-lobby.html`

### To Ensure Railway Server is Running:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Check that your project is deployed
3. Verify the WebSocket URL is correct
4. Make sure the domain matches in your `multiplayer-lobby.html` file

## Next Steps for Admin Panel Enhancements

If you want to add maintenance mode and user management to the admin panel, let me know and I can:
1. Add maintenance mode toggle that syncs with database
2. Add user list with real-time stats from Supabase
3. Add data export functionality
4. Ensure all stats sync properly with the database

## Current Status

‚úÖ Admin panel removed from public homepage
‚úÖ Multiplayer lobby configured with Railway
üîÑ Ready to push changes to GitHub
‚è≥ Admin panel enhancements (waiting for your confirmation)
