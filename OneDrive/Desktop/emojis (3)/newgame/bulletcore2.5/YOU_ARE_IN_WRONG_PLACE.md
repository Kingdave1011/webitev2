# ❌ STOP! You're In The Wrong Place!

## The Problem:

You're in **AWS CloudShell** (Linux bash shell).

Your game server is on **EC2 Windows Server** (18.116.64.173).

**These are completely different computers!**

---

## ✅ Correct Way: Use Remote Desktop

### Step-by-Step:

**1. Close AWS CloudShell** - it's useless for this task

**2. On YOUR Windows PC:**
   - Press `Windows Key + R`
   - Type: `mstsc`
   - Press Enter

**3. In Remote Desktop window:**
   - Computer: `18.116.64.173`
   - Click "Connect"
   - Username: `Administrator`
   - Password: (your EC2 password)

**4. Once connected to EC2 desktop:**
   - Open PowerShell (right-click Start → PowerShell Admin)
   - Now run the commands:

```powershell
npm install -g pm2
cd C:\gameservers  
pm2 start matchmaking-server.cjs --name "multiplayer-server"
pm2 save
pm2 status
```

## Why CloudShell Doesn't Work:

| AWS CloudShell | EC2 Windows Server |
|----------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Linux bash | ✅ Windows PowerShell |
| ❌ Temporary | ✅ Your game server |
| ❌ No C:\ drive | ✅ Has C:\gameservers |
| ❌ Players can't connect | ✅ Players connect here |
| ❌ Not your server | ✅ IP: 18.116.64.173 |

---

## Quick Summary:

**STOP using CloudShell!**

**START using Remote Desktop (mstsc) to connect to 18.116.64.173**

That's where your game server runs!

*AWS CloudShell is only for managing AWS, not for running your game server!*
